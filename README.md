# The Greater Suspender

## What it is
With this repository I'm trying to keep the great project behind the scandal and downfall of "The Great Suspender" alive.
I really liked the idea of freeing up as much resources as possible and The great Suspender was among the standard extensions I used in almost all of my Chrome profiles. Learning that The great Suspender extension has been corrupted by malicious code was pretty shocking to me. 
My objective for now is to pick up the pieces and strip them of any malicious code, backdoors and unnecessary requests so the extension does exactly and only what it's designed to do. 

## What it does
The Greater Suspender is a free and open-source Google Chrome extension for people who find that chrome is consuming too much system resource or suffer from frequent chrome crashing. Once installed and enabled, this extension will automatically suspend tabs that have not been used for a while, freeing up memory and cpu that the tab was consuming.

## What it needs
-Some Time!
Sadly I'm a one man army with a full time job so the development and fixing of issues might take a bit. 
-Some Help!
Contributions to this project are greatly appreciated. 
Also everyone is invited to have a look at the extensions code and alert us about anything that seems remotely malicious or out of place.
